*React Native vs React.js: -React is a very popular JAVA SCRIPT LIBRARY not a FrameWork. -LAS Debilidades de React vs Angular y Vue, q es una Librería focalizada en componentes, crear y represntar componentes, (building and rendering components.)

Aparte de esto there is no built-in router, contiene mas q todo un administrador de estados de componentes, obviously within a component and with react context also across compoments -Though that is not really a perfect state management solution for fast changes or for high-frecuency changes.

*Como Usar https://github.com/
-Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Something like:
•	story.txt
•	story-joe-edit.txt
•	story-joe-edit-reviewed.txt
Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.
